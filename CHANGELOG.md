# Changelog

All notable changes to FoodXpress for WooCommerce will be documented in this file.

The format is based on [Keep a Changelog](https://keepachangelog.com/en/1.0.0/).

## [1.2.0] - 2026-08-17

### Changed (refactor & hygiene)
- **Split `class-fxw-checkout.php` (1,046 LOC) into 3 single-purpose files**
  - `class-fxw-checkout.php` (233 LOC) — orchestrator: renders the checkout form, hides default WC fields, pre-fills saved address
  - `class-fxw-checkout-maps.php` (299 LOC) — frontend map assets + `get_restaurant_location` AJAX + admin debug status
  - `class-fxw-checkout-handler.php` (469 LOC) — server-side: location update, zone validation, address save, order meta
- **Extracted two reusable services** to keep all classes under 500 LOC:
  - `includes/services/class-fxw-delivery-fee.php` — cart-fee + shipping-label ETA hooks (`add_delivery_fee`, `append_eta_to_label`)
  - `includes/services/class-fxw-address-validator.php` — stateless `validate_address_completeness` heuristic (previously dead private code; preserved for Phase 7 multi-outlet editor)
- **Comprehensive `.gitignore`** replacing the 4-line `.DS_Store`-only file: OS, editors/IDE, AI tool configs (`.agent/`, `.claude/`, `.cursorrules`, etc.), PHP/Composer/Psalm/PHPStan, logs, build artifacts, TestSprite/Playwright outputs, env/secrets
- **Added `LICENSE.md`** — proprietary license text matching the plugin header, with third-party-component carve-out for WordPress/WooCommerce (GPL-2.0+)
- **Test runner updated** to verify the new files exist and that all four checkout files have proper nonce verification

### Removed (bloat cleanup)
- 9 AI-tool config folders (`.agent/`, `.agents/`, `.claude/`, `.cline/`, `.codex/`, `.cursor/`, `.gemini/`, `.kiro/`, `.vscode/`)
- AI-tool dev docs at the repo root (`.cursorrules`, `CLAUDE.md`, `AGENTS.md`, `.github/copilot-instructions.md`)
- Vim swap file (`.CLAUDE.md.swp`)

### Impact
- The largest class in the codebase is now `FXW_Dashboard` (593 LOC) — every class stays under the 500-LOC ceiling except this single legacy file, which is queued for the same split treatment in a later refactor pass
- GitHub language detection switches from "Python" (driven by `.agent/skills/*/scripts/*.py` files) to "PHP" — the repo is now accurately classified
- No runtime behavior change. All hooks, AJAX endpoints, and class names are preserved
- The orchestrator file (`class-fxw-checkout.php`) keeps its name and call site, so external code referencing it continues to work without modification
